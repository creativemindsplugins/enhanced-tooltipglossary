## Introduction

[Glossary Pro Plugin](https://www.cminds.com/wordpress-plugins-library/tooltipglossary/) | [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUgPw0Lem0AFU9lqQrY0kgc6NN0Qcjf2P) | [Demo](https://www.glossaryplugin.com/demo/) | [User Guide](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/category/6-tooltip-glossary-cmtg) | [AddOns](https://www.cminds.com/wordpress-plugins-library/?showfilter=No&tags=TooltipAddOn) 

**The CM Tooltip Glossary is the top choice for a WordPress plugin that lets you build a knowledgebase with term definitions, like a glossary or dictionary**.

You can display fancy tooltips with term definitions when hovering on the term automatically found in the content. This plugin is strong and has been getting better since 2012, making it easy to create a big collection of terms and definitions on your site.

## Installation and Usage

### How to Install

> [Detailed Free Version User Guide](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/article/2162-cm-tooltip-cmtg-free-version-tutorial)

* Move the plugin folder into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Switch on the plugin from the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
* In the admin area, under ‘Glossary’, input your terms; use the page title for the term and the body for its definition.
* Optionally, build a ‘Glossary’ page for a collective index of terms. Without it, terms will be highlighted but not listed together.
* Define a custom page ID of your ‘Glossary’ page in the plugin’s settings.
* Explore the dashboard for more optional customizations.

Remember, your theme must `include wp_head()` for the Tooltip’s JavaScript and CSS to function. If not, you’ll need to add these files to your theme manually, which is not advised.

### Code and Style Issues

The Glossary tool uses simple JavaScript to make little info boxes, called tooltips. These were inspired by an article from Michael Leigeber [here](http://sixrevisions.com/tutorials/javascript_tutorial/create_lightweight_javascript_tooltip/).

You can change how these tooltips look like and work with the tooltip.css and tooltip.js files.

Also, the Glossary’s A-to-Z list is made using the [jQuery ListNav Plugin](http://www.ihwy.com/labs/jquery-listnav-plugin.aspx).

## Glossary Terms Pages, Links and Glosary Index

This plugin finds special terms in your posts or pages and links them to a page that explains them in detail. It also makes an index that organizes all these glossary terms from your site, so people can easily find and understand them.

## Glossary Tooltips

Also, this tool has a feature to show a little info box quickly when someone hovers over the terms, making it super easy for them to get the meaning right away.

## Glossary Premium Editions

The [Premium versions of the Glossary Plugin](https://www.cminds.com/wordpress-plugins-library/tooltipglossary/) come with lots of extra other options. You can add audio and video for tooltips, synonyms and varations, integrate with Wikipedia, Google Translate, Merriam-Webster, ChatGPT; you can create multiple glossaries, choose from different index designs, and much more.
